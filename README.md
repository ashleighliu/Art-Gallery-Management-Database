  The Art Gallery Management Database is a website designed with PHP/MySQL. It's a simple project that will help art galleries to manage all art pieces in their inventory. 
  The system:
   - keeps track and notifies users of upcoming events and advertisement from both artists and the art museum staff
   - stores the information of each painting or sculpture including the artist who created the piece 
   - includes also simple sale management system, which the art gallery staff may use to indicate which paintings are for sale 
   - features a buyer request system, where the customer can place an order for a piece of artwork
   - redirects the art piece buyer's information to the art gallery staff, for easy contact
