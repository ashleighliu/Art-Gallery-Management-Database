  The Art Gallery Management Database is a website designed with PHP/MySQL. It's a simple project that will help art galleries to manage all art pieces in their inventory. <br />
  The system:<br />
   - keeps track and notifies users of upcoming events and advertisement from both artists and the art museum staff<br />
   - stores the information of each painting or sculpture including the artist who created the piece <br />
   - includes also simple sale management system, which the art gallery staff may use to indicate which paintings are for sale <br />
   - features a buyer request system, where the customer can place an order for a piece of artwork<br />
   - redirects the art piece buyer's information to the art gallery staff, for easy contact<br />
